# Improvement Ideas

## Stagnating Coin

- After coins have been bought, they could stagnate, preventing us from buying real moonshots
- The bot could keep them together if they stay between the original SL and TP
- We code an optional mode where we check if a coin has NEVER breached the TP (don't need to check the SL because if not it would be sold already)
- If a certain time passes and you don't reach the TP, we give up on the coin
- Careful not to do this, if not we'll end up just losing cents every hour


## Drop Everything and MoonShot

- We need to receive signals from extreme moonshots, other than our normal checks
- if a coin is going up EXTREMELY, let's drop our shittiest coin (with worse profit? Or with best profit) and literally just jump on that one
